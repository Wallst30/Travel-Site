 Since I could remember all I ever wanted to do was travel. Travel to at least every country, island, and explore every continent! My name is George, and have currently traveled to three countries so far besides living in America. Here are some cool pictures and videos of my travels! I hope you enjoy and visit them on your own! Ill even include some cool trip advisor sites to look at.

<p>In Mexico I have traveled to cancun, tulum, playa del carmen,and the Yucatan Peninsula which is where Chichen Itza resides infamously known as one of the worlds seven wonders. In tulum i stood in the Royal Catolina Resort and in Cancun the Hardrock Cafe resort. Both wonderful places to stay Royal was more of a jungle theme and vibe and Hardrock was party after party. </p>
